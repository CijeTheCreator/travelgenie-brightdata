## How it works

1. User inputs destination and trip dates.
2. Travel Genie fetches real-time flight and hotel prices.
3. Prices are converted to the userâ€™s local currency and summed for total trip cost.
4. The agent scrapes live sentiment data from platforms like Reddit.
5. It identifies trending activities and safety insights based on user content.
6. A personalized itinerary is generated using this data.
7. The itinerary is formatted as a calendar.
8. Users can export it to Google Calendar, Spplr, or others.
9. Visa requirements are checked via real-time scraping from visaindex.com.
